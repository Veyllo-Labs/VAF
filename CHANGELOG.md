# Changelog

All notable changes to VAF are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and VAF aims to follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, with PEP 440
prerelease suffixes such as `a0` / `b1` / `rc1`).

Each released version has a matching git tag `v<version>` and a GitHub Release.
To update an installed VAF, run `vaf update`.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0a4] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- **Workflow/automation files stay in the run's chat workspace.** A workflow step that
  wrote a file with a bare relative name resolved it against the backend process working
  directory (the user's home root), where the file endpoint then refused to serve it —
  clicking the file chip navigated the whole desktop window to a raw `{"detail":"Access
  denied"}` page with no way back. Relative new-artifact paths in `write_file`/`move_file`
  steps now resolve against the shared per-run project directory; explicit absolute/`~`
  paths, folder aliases, and in-place updates of existing files are left untouched. The
  `WriteFileTool` home-reroute guard (dead for months due to a shadowed import) is
  restored, and the coder's CONTENT_ONLY cleanup only removes its own temp directories,
  never an injected workspace (which had deleted freshly written files).
- **Created-file chips never dead-end the UI.** Extension-less files open in the in-app
  viewer; downloads use the native Save-As bridge in the desktop window and a safe blob
  download in the browser, with a toast on failure instead of a full-window navigation.
  Raw file links are excluded from the desktop same-window link rewrite.
- **In-app update notes now appear for pre-alpha installs** whose stored acknowledgement
  used the old internal version numbering, and long release notes scroll inside the card.
- **Security:** refreshed the WhatsApp bridge and web dependency locks — all critical and
  high advisories resolved (63 of 64 alerts; the last is fixed by a future Next upgrade).

### Added
- VAF records itself as a co-author on commits it creates.

## [0.1.0a3] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- **In-app update notes.** After an update, the Web UI shows a one-time "What's new"
  window with the changes of the new version (same place as the first-run alpha
  notice; acknowledged per user). Alpha releases are now compared at full-version
  granularity so every release can carry notes.

### Fixed
- **Windows: installing without WSL2 no longer fails at the Rancher Desktop step.**
  The installer now checks WSL2 first (locale-independent, no admin needed for the
  check), enables it via a single UAC prompt when missing (no Linux distribution is
  installed; `dism` fallback for older Windows 10 builds), sets version 2 as the
  default, and pauses cleanly with resume instructions when Windows needs the
  restart (exit code 3010 is treated as a planned pause, not an error). An already
  running Linux container engine (e.g. Docker Desktop on Hyper-V) skips the check.

## [0.1.0a2] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- **First-run setup no longer races the database (all platforms, worst on Windows).**
  The Docker stack starts in parallel with the web server; when PostgreSQL was not
  ready in time (a first Rancher/WSL2 boot takes minutes), the auth tables were never
  created and a fresh install showed a login form with no account to log in to.
  Startup now gives the database a short head start, the auth-table init retries in
  the background until the database is ready (never giving up), and the login page
  shows "Starting the database..." and switches to the setup wizard on its own.
- **macOS: the memory stack starts even when the docker CLI lacks the compose
  plugin** (Homebrew docker + Colima: `docker compose` failed with
  `unknown shorthand flag: 'f'` while the standalone `docker-compose` binary was
  installed and working). VAF now detects the missing plugin and falls back to the
  legacy binary; real compose errors still surface unchanged.
- **Local model loads reliably (llama-server startup).** Server readiness now
  requires `/health` = 200 — llama-server answers 503 while the model is still
  loading, and accepting any response green-lit servers that died seconds later,
  causing an endless relaunch loop with orphaned processes. Slow cold loads get a
  generous configurable budget (`server_ready_timeout`) instead of being killed
  mid-load. When the backend has no Flash Attention kernel for the model (e.g.
  Qwen3.5 on Apple Metal), the quantized V cache made the server die at context
  init — VAF now retries once with an f16 V cache and remembers the outcome.
  Server output is always captured to `logs/server_last.log` (crashes left zero
  diagnostics before).
- **macOS: `model: "auto"` now scales with the machine.** Apple Silicon reported
  0 GB GPU memory, so every Mac downloaded the smallest 4B/Q4 model. The GPU
  budget is now 65% of unified memory (capped at RAM minus 6 GB for the OS and
  services), so e.g. a 32 GB Mac gets the 9B model while a 16 GB Mac stays on the
  4B tier that actually fits.
- **macOS: microphone/STT works in the desktop window.** The installer adds the
  microphone usage description to the host Python.app (with safe re-signing and
  rollback), and VAF grants WebKit microphone capture — scoped to the local WebUI
  origin and microphone-only, so pages loaded in-window (OAuth, model-card links)
  can never capture audio. Note: a `brew upgrade python@X.Y` reverts the plist
  patch; re-run `scripts/macos_mic_plist.sh` (the startup log warns about it).

### Changed
- Windows quickstart in the README works on stock PowerShell 5.1 (no `&&`,
  `install.bat` instead of calling `install.ps1` directly).

## [0.1.0a1] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- **macOS: VAF now starts.** The launcher (`run_vaf.sh`) exec'd the raw Homebrew
  framework Python instead of the venv's Python after activating the venv, so every
  dependency showed up as "missing" and startup failed (worse on a Homebrew Python
  3.14 machine, where it hunted for the 3.14 framework binary). It now runs
  `venv/bin/python` directly — a framework build, so the menu-bar tray still works,
  and it sees the installed packages.
- **macOS: the menu-bar tray icon no longer crashes** (`AssertionError: self.png
  is None`, resulting in no tray icon). The icon PNG was opened lazily and read by
  pystray from its own thread while being rewritten on every call; it is now decoded
  eagerly and written atomically (temp file + rename).
- **macOS: the onboarding step animation no longer "double-plays"** (jump up, snap
  back, then slow slide) in the WebKit/WKWebView desktop window — a framer-motion
  v10 WAAPI commit-timing re-read triggered by a reflow mid-transition. The steps
  now animate on the main thread via an `onUpdate` shim.

## [0.1.0a0] - 2026-06-30

### Changed
- **Thinking-mode proactive questions are now delivered to your configured main messenger**
  (Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord) and tracked as a request there, instead of only the Web UI. If a
  messenger question goes unanswered it is escalated once to the Web UI with a note that it was
  already asked on that channel; with no messenger configured the behaviour is unchanged. The
  background run now contacts you exclusively through `ask_user` (all raw `send_*` tools are removed
  from thinking runs), and `ask_user` carries the running user's real scope so a non-admin's question
  is never delivered to the admin's messenger. `send_whatsapp_reply` now reports real delivery, so a
  down WhatsApp bridge falls back to the Web UI instead of silently dropping the message.
- **License: relicensed from "MIT + Commons Clause v1.0" to a dual license — GNU
  AGPL-3.0-or-later (open source) plus a separate Commercial License.** `LICENSE` now
  carries the verbatim AGPL-3.0 text; see the new `LICENSING.md` (dual-license explanation,
  EN/DE) and `COMMERCIAL.md` (commercial/Enterprise terms). Building Plugins, Tools, and
  Workflows on top of VAF stays permission-free via an AGPL Section 7 additional permission.
  Contributor terms in `CONTRIBUTING.md` updated: contributions are accepted under the AGPL
  inbound plus a separate commercial-relicensing grant to Veyllo GmbH (so the dual-license
  model is enforceable), with a DCO `git commit -s` sign-off certifying origin. Source files
  now carry `SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later` headers pointing to `LICENSING.md`.

### Added
- Vision-as-a-tool for attached images (`vision_mode: "description_tool"`, default):
  the main model is text-only — an attached image is described once via the vision
  backend, that description is injected as text, and the new `analyze_image` tool
  re-inspects the image on demand (exact colours, positions, small text, finding an
  object). Token-efficient, works even with a non-vision main provider, and the image
  description survives reloads / the worker pool. `vision_mode: "inline_multimodal"`
  restores the previous raw-image behaviour. New keys `vision_mode` /
  `vision_description_max_tokens`; see `docs/llm/API_INTEGRATION.md`. Uploaded images are
  now stored as **files** in the user-siloed chat folder
  (`VAF_Projects/<uid8>/<session_id>/attachments/`) with only the path in `session.json`
  (no more inline base64 bloat); the agent can reference them by path and the Web UI
  re-displays them after reload via `/api/file`. Legacy base64 sessions keep working.
- Embeddable library surface: `from vaf import Agent` (`docs/EMBEDDING.md`,
  `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`); slim base install plus optional extras in `setup.py`.
- Entry-point tool discovery: third-party tools via the `vaf.tools` group.
- Tool input validation & repair before dispatch (`docs/agents/TOOL_INPUT_REPAIR.md`).
- Self-update: `vaf update check` / `vaf update`, an opt-in startup
  update-available hint, and a tag-triggered GitHub release workflow.
- Web search result cache: identical `web_search` queries are served from a
  short-lived file cache (default 15 min; `web_search_cache_enabled` /
  `web_search_cache_ttl_seconds`), skipping the providers and synthesis.
- Email subsystem hardening. **New config key `email_allow_private_hosts` (default
  `false`)**: IMAP/SMTP hosts that resolve to loopback / RFC-1918 private / link-local
  addresses (incl. the `169.254` metadata range) are refused as an SSRF guard unless this
  is enabled. IMAP/SMTP connections now verify TLS certificates against the system trust
  store (connect timeouts; port 465 uses implicit SMTP_SSL). `GET /api/config` redacts
  secret keys (`api_key_*`, `*_secret`, `*_password`, `memory_db_url`, `redis_url`,
  encryption keys, ...) for non-admin users; admins still receive everything.
  `POST /api/email/accounts/test` now requires authentication and is rate-limited (shared
  per-IP login limiter). OAuth PKCE state files (email + cloud) are written atomically with
  `0600` permissions, and token-endpoint errors are no longer logged verbatim.
- `send_mail` now supports `cc`, `bcc`, and reply threading via `in_reply_to` /
  `references`, with recipient-address validation.

### Fixed
- Filesystem alias resolution now matches only on a path boundary.
- `send_mail` no longer silently drops a single string attachment path.
- Mailbox authentication/connection failures now surface as an "authentication failed"
  error from `mail_inbox` / `read_mail` instead of an empty "no messages" result.
- Email headers (From/To/Subject) are now RFC 2047-decoded and message bodies are decoded
  with the part's declared charset (previously hardcoded UTF-8).
- Switching to an unowned/new session now resets the agent's current user scope/username,
  preventing cross-user identity bleed; UUID-scoped network users' mailboxes are now
  included in email auto-sync.
- Cloud storage OAuth (Google Drive etc.) now opens in the system browser instead of the
  embedded desktop webview, and its callback uses the same effective HTTPS proxy port as
  email (shared `vaf/network/oauth_redirect` helper) instead of an unreliable
  `request.base_url`, so connecting cloud accounts works on the Linux/macOS desktop.
- Cloud OAuth tokens for the local admin are found again: the cloud credential key is now
  normalized identically for storage and lookup (tokens were stored under the raw admin
  username but looked up normalized, causing a false "Credentials not found").
