"""Run the suite in an environment that is deliberately less generous than this one.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Three CI failures in a row were environment differences, not
logic errors, and the local suite could not have caught any of them because it
only ever runs in ONE environment: this workstation, UTF-8 output, Linux, every
optional dependency installed and every model already downloaded.

  - A key-placement branch that only Windows takes.
  - Output a cp1252 console cannot encode. Our stdout is UTF-8, so the crash was
    unreachable here.
  - A voice test that silently needed a model file this machine had cached and a
    fresh runner did not, reporting "engine unavailable" where the test expected
    "too short".

Each cost a round trip through CI, and the Windows entry takes 27 minutes to
answer. This script makes the cheap two thirds of that variance reproducible
locally, in the time the suite already takes:

  NARROW OUTPUT   PYTHONIOENCODING=cp1252, so any print of a character outside
                  that code page fails here rather than on the Windows runner.
  NO EXTRAS       the optional, heavy, sometimes-network-fetching packages are
                  hidden from the import system, so a test that quietly depends
                  on one fails here rather than on the runner that lacks it.
  SCRATCH HOME    HOME points at a throwaway directory. Not a CI concern - a
                  safety one. The suite has twice written into the real user
                  store, once destroying a recovery key, and the isolation
                  fixtures do not cover every axis.

WHAT IT CANNOT DO. Real Windows file semantics - ACLs, MoveFileEx sharing
violations, the read-only-flag-only chmod - need a real Windows machine. Those
are covered by seams and simulated branches in tests/test_at_rest_cross_platform.py
instead, and the honest boundary is written down there rather than pretended
away here. Windows-only SERIALIZATION defects (str(PurePath) renders with the
host's separator, invisible on Linux where it equals as_posix) are covered by a
static guard, tests/test_windows_path_hygiene.py, which fails on any OS. The
standing rule: every Windows CI red that the local gates could not have caught
adds its class to one of these three places in the SAME fix - a hostile axis
here, a simulated branch there, or a static guard.
