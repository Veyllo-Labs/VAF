# AgentAvatar — Design & Behaviour

## Core Idea

The avatar is **not an icon, not a robot, not a symbol** — it is the agent itself.  
A living, organic dot that shows the user what the agent is doing internally right now.  
Like a facial expression, but abstract.

## Visual States

### 1. `idle` — Resting (latest message)
- **Appearance:** Two-layer white dot:
  - **Back layer** — larger (20 px), blurred (`blur(2.5px)`), semi-transparent (`opacity: 0.13`), morphing aura via `agentAvatarMorph 4.5s` (phase-offset by 1.2 s so it feels independent)
  - **Front layer** — sharp white circle (14 px), floats + deforms via `agentAvatarIdleFloat 15s` (scale + translate + border-radius morphing combined)
- **Background:** Dark container (`bg-gray-900`), rounded corners (`rounded-xl`)
- **Feel:** The agent is present but passive. Quietly alive — the aura softly shifts shape around the dot.
- **When:** Most recent completed bot message, no active streaming

### 1b. `idle + dim` — Resting (older messages)
- **Appearance:** Gray circle (`#b0b0b0`), completely still — no animation
- **Background:** Light gray container (`bg-gray-200`)
- **Feel:** Archive. The agent was here, now this message is history.
- **When:** All completed bot messages except the most recent one

---

### 2. `waiting` — System pipeline / before actual processing
- **Appearance:** White dot (`#ffffff`), subtle glow
- **Animation:** Very slow morph (`agentAvatarMorph` 5.5 s) + very slow breathe (`agentAvatarBreathe` 4.0 s)
- **Feel:** Relaxed, patient. "We're here, everything is running, no rush."
- **When:** System steps running (Router, RAG, info-tools) — after the prompt but before actual thinking or answering

---

### 3. `thinking` — Reasoning / think-tags active
- **Appearance:** White dot (`#ffffff`), visible glow (`rgba(255,255,255,0.35)`)
- **Animation:** Two overlapping animations
  - `agentAvatarMorph` — organic border-radius transitions (1.0 s)
  - `agentAvatarBreathe` — scale pulse 1.0 → 1.18 → 1.0 (0.7 s)
- **Feel:** Focused, turned inward. Steady and deliberate.
- **When:** `<think>` tag is open but `</think>` has not yet appeared

---

### 4. `talking` — Answer is streaming
- **Appearance:** White dot (`#ffffff`), slightly larger (15 px vs 14 px), intense glow
- **Animation:** `agentAvatarTalk` — looped (0.75 s)
  - Scale and shape change: 1.0 → 1.38 → 0.74 → 1.30 → 0.80 → 1.0
  - Border-radius shifts in sync — larger = more oval, smaller = more compressed
- **Feel:** Speaking, articulating. Energetic, present, direct.
- **When:** `</think>` is closed, answer text is streaming

---

## Transitions

- `idle → waiting/thinking/talking`: white dot springs in with bounce curve (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`), idle dot shrinks and fades simultaneously
- `thinking → talking`: animation switches immediately — the moment thinking becomes speaking is intentionally abrupt
- `talking/thinking → idle`: active dot shrinks and fades with fast ease-in, idle dot eases back in with float animation

---

## Position in Chat

```
[●] Message text...
 ↑
 AgentAvatar (w-9 h-9, bg-gray-900, rounded-xl)
```

The avatar always sits to the left of the bubble, aligned to the top of the message.  
Older messages: `dim` prop → light gray box, gray static dot.

---

## Usage Map

| Context | Mode | dim |
|---|---|---|
| Last bot message while streaming (think-tag open) | `thinking` | false |
| Last bot message while streaming (answer running) | `talking` | false |
| Most recent completed bot message | `idle` | false |
| All older completed bot messages | `idle` | true |
| Loading bubble (no response yet) | `waiting` | false |
| SystemStep (Router, RAG, info-tools) active | `waiting` | false |
| SystemStep done | `idle` | false |
| Workflow message | `idle` | false |

---

## Implementation

**File:** `web/app/page.tsx` — component `AgentAvatar`  
**Keyframes:** defined in `web/app/globals.css` (always available on first paint — no runtime injection)  
**Props:** `mode: 'idle' | 'waiting' | 'thinking' | 'talking'` (default: `'idle'`), `dim: boolean` (default: `false`)

**State mapping:**
- `loading === true` → pre-stream (no token yet) → `waiting`
- `isGenerating === true, loading === false` → streaming active → `thinking` or `talking`
- both false, latest message → `idle` (no dim)
- both false, older message → `idle + dim`

```tsx
<AgentAvatar mode="waiting" />
<AgentAvatar mode="thinking" />
<AgentAvatar mode="talking" />
<AgentAvatar />              // idle, latest
<AgentAvatar mode="idle" dim />  // idle, older message
```

## Design Principle

> The avatar should make the user feel like they are interacting with something alive —  
> not an app. Animation speed and intensity are directly coupled to the agent's cognitive state:  
> slow and relaxed while waiting, steady while thinking, rhythmic while speaking.  
> White = present. Dim gray = history.
